"""Embedded MQTT broker using amqtt with Aliyun IoT auth.

The device connects over TLS (Aliyun securemode=2). We keep a plain-TCP
listener for the internal bridge and, when enabled, add a TLS listener on the
device-facing port. The device patches mbedtls to skip cert verification, so a
self-signed cert is sufficient.

This broker exists so the device has somewhere to connect that behaves like
Aliyun IoT; it is NOT Home Assistant's broker (that one is Mosquitto, spoken to
by `ha/publisher.py`). Both run in the same process, and `mqtt/bridge.py` is
the client that joins them.

"""Device codename tables: which models exist, what they are and what they can do.

A device identifies itself only by a lowercase codename ("t5", "d4h", ...) — the
firmware never states its category, whether it has a camera or what its
commercial name is. Every such fact is answered from the sets below, so a new
model is supported by adding its codename here rather than by touching the
payload builders, entity tables and parsers that ask these questions.

The sets are the raw data; `devices/base.py` exposes them as the `Device.is_*`
predicates the rest of the code actually reads.

#: The running version, shown in the panel's Setup tab and served by /api/info.
#:
#: A literal, not `importlib.metadata`: the Dockerfile copies the package in
#: rather than pip-installing it, so there is no distribution to ask, and the
#: add-on has no reliable way to read its own `config.yaml` at runtime.
#:
#: `tests/test_version.py` asserts it equals `config.yaml` and `pyproject.toml`,
#: which is what stops a bump from landing in two places out of three.
#:
#: The panel shows it because there is otherwise no way — for an owner or for
#: us — to tell which build is running: a stale entity set looks exactly like an
#: update that did not take.

# This is not cosmetic: the D4SH firmware (867, `ctrl`,
# `parse_service_invoke_msg`) compares its own model string against "D4SH" and
# in that branch reads ONLY `amount1`/`amount2` from a `feed_realtime`. The
# plain `amount` every other feeder takes is not looked at, so a dual-hopper
# sent one runs a feed cycle and dispenses nothing -- issue #2, where both
# hoppers reported `real_amount: 0` for a command that was well formed and
# asked for nothing.
#
# Membership is by codename because that IS the test the firmware makes: the
# string it compares is its own model, and `d4sh` is the codename for the
# YumShare Dual-Hopper. The neighbouring branch compares "D4H" and reads
# `amount`, which is why the single-hopper path below must stay exactly as it

# Models with no network of their own. They pair over BLE to a WiFi device --
# a litter box or a feeder -- which relays for them, so they never sign up, never
# hold MQTT credentials and never poll a heartbeat. Their readings arrive inside
# their parent's traffic (`devices/ble/`), and a `Device` for one of these
# codenames means something went wrong upstream, not that a new model appeared.
#
# The fountains were listed as network devices because PetKit's cloud API models
# them that way -- the account-side view is identical whether the fountain has
# WiFi or is being relayed, which is exactly why the distinction was missed.
#
# Evidence per model:
#   * w4, w5, ctw2 -- one BLE protocol, one pair of GATT UUIDs and one parser
#     serve all three in `phldgmn/ha-petkit-ble`, whose advertised names are
#     `Petkit_W5`/`W5C`/`W5N`, `Petkit_W4X`/`W4XUVC` and `Petkit_CTW2`. It is a
#     relay-less, cloud-less integration; a device with WiFi would not need it.
#   * ctw3 -- the CT-W3 manual: monitoring over Bluetooth, and remote access
#     only by pairing with a PetKit feeder or litter box within ~8 m acting as
#     the WiFi master. That master is the relay, not the fountain.
#   * k2, k3 -- the Pura Air spray, BLE-only since the first model.

# Only the W7H has WiFi of its own among the fountains.

# the non-camera feeders — ESP32, going by the D4, Feeder Mini and T4 images)

# True once a device has actually asked for those endpoints, because a codename
# cannot answer the question on its own —
#
#   * PetKit's own "Pet Identification" screen lists three litter boxes (Purobot
#     Max Pro 2, Purobot Ultra, Purobot Max Pro), two feeders (YumShare Solo 2,
#     Dual-Hopper 2) and one fountain (EverSweet Ultra AI). `w7h` is here for
#     that last one.
#   * It also says the NON-"2" YumShare Solo and Dual-Hopper do NOT do
#     recognition — and both generations share one codename (`d4h` / `d4sh`;
#     localkit's own gen-2 branch handles the newer one as plain `d4sh` and
#     introduces no new name). So no list keyed on codename can be right for the
#     feeders, and they are deliberately absent: a gen-2 earns `supports_ai` by
#     polling, a gen-1 never does.
#   * "Purobot Max Pro" (without the 2) maps to no codename in this repo or in
#     localkit. Same resolution — it will identify itself by asking.
#   * `t7` is ours but is NOT on PetKit's list. Left in rather than removed:
#     nothing suggests it lacks the NPU, and dropping it would take the feature
#     away from anyone using one.

# Commercial product names per device codename. Verified against pypetkitapi

# Purobot Max Pro 2). A codename that is not listed here is still supported —
# see `device_display_name` for what is shown for it.
#
# Two entries are known to be imprecise, and are left as they are because the
# alternative is a guess:
#   * `d4h`/`d4sh` — PetKit sells a "2" of each (YumShare Solo 2, Dual-Hopper 2)
#     that shares the codename, so one name here covers two products that differ
#     in whether they can recognise a pet at all. See DEVICE_TYPES_AI above.
#   * `t7` — localkit calls it "Purobot Crystal"; pypetkitapi says "Crystal Duo".
#     Unresolved without hardware.
#   * `k2` — the generation before the K3, named by analogy. PetKit's own listing
#     for it could not be found.
#
# `d4` was "Feeder D4" — the codename dressed up as a product, which is what
# this table exists to avoid. Its owner named it in issue #3: a **Fresh Element
# Solo**. `d3` and `d4s` are still the codename echoed back, for want of anybody
# to ask; if you own one, the name on the box is the whole contribution needed.
#
# `k2`/`k3` were "Air Purifier K2"/"Air Purifier K3" here, which is wrong and
# actively misleading: PetKit also sells real air purifiers. These are the Pura
# Air smart spray, a Bluetooth deodoriser that mounts inside a litter box (or on
# a wall) and sprays after a visit. Several retailers do list the K3 as an "air
# purifier", which is presumably where the name came from.

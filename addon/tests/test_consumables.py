"""The N50/N60 replacement dates we record ourselves.

The N50 has no representation anywhere in the device protocol: PetKit keeps its
replacement date in their own account database, and resetting it from their app
sends the box nothing but a display poke. So "N50 Days Left" can only ever read
what WE remember, which is what these tests pin.

The N60 does have a device field (`sprayResetTime`), and the device wins there --
it is resettable from PetKit's app too. Our copy exists so the countdown
survives a restart and so `to_device_info` never echoes a zero over a live reset
date.
